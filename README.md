# Gallery Template
This code is open source and free to use in your websites. Just copy & paste the respective code where you want it and away you go! The gallery is responsive from large screens to mobiles, and the code can be adjusted as you see fit.

## Wordpress
To use this template in wordpress, simply add the default wordpress gallery widget to the page that you add this template to and the code should do the rest. For the icons, the fontawesome CDN needs to be added to the head element at the top of the page.

## Plain HTML
For plain HTML, you'll need to dissect the code a bit to remove it from the head tags that are used to display the demo of the page.

## Notes
Due to the use of <kbd>object-fit: cover</kbd>, this will not be compatible with IE11 or lower.
